/**
 * This class holds all information about when {@link MasterBar}s and {@link Beat}s are played.
 *
 * On top level it is organized into {@link MasterBarTickLookup} objects indicating the
 * master bar start and end times. This information is used to highlight the currently played bars
 * and it gives access to the played beats in this masterbar and their times.
 *
 * The {@link BeatTickLookup} are then the slices into which the masterbar is separated by the voices and beats
 * of all tracks. An example how things are organized:
 *
 * Time (eighths):  | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
 *
 * Track 1:         |        B1         |        B2         |    B3   |    B4   |    B5   |    B6   |
 * Track 2:         |                  B7                   |         B7        | B9 | B10| B11| B12|
 * Track 3:         |                                      B13                                      |
 *
 * Lookup:          |        L1         |        L2         |    L3    |   L4   | L5 | L6 | L7 | L8 |
 * Active Beats:
 * - L1             B1,B7,B13
 * - L2                                 B2,B7,B13
 * - L3                                                      B3,B7,B13
 * - L4                                                                 B4,B7,B13
 * - L5                                                                          B5,B9,B13
 * - L6                                                                               B5,B10,B13
 * - L7                                                                                    B6,B11,B13
 * - L8                                                                                         B6,B12,B13
 *
 * Then during playback we build out of this list {@link MidiTickLookupFindBeatResult} objects which are sepcific
 * to the visible tracks displayed. This is required because if only Track 2 is displayed we cannot use the the
 * Lookup L1 alone to determine the start and end of the beat cursor. In this case we will derive a
 * MidiTickLookupFindBeatResult which holds for Time 01 the lookup L1 as start and L3 as end. This will be used
 * both for the cursor and beat highlighting.
